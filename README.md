# Wagtail User Workspace

This app creates personal workspace page for every user on registration.

Users are able to publish new child pages under their workspace page. This includes minimal needed permissions to do so. Namely access to Wagtail admin and add, edit and publish permissions to their own workspace page.

Structure and type of these pages is higly customisable.
